# CCPP-Electric-Power-output-prediction
Regression model that helps predict electric power generated during the operation of Combine Cycle Power Plant operation.
A combined cycle power plant is composed of gas turbines (GT), steam turbines (ST) and heat recovery steam generators (HRSG). In a CCPP, the electricity is generated by gas and steam turbines, which are combined in one cycle, and is transferred from one turbine to another. A gas turbine in a combined cycle system does not only generate the electrical power but also generates fairly hot exhaust. Routing these gases through a water-cooled heat exchanger produces steam, which can be turned into electric power with a coupled steam turbine and generator. Hence, a gas turbine generator generates electricity and waste heat of the exhaust gases is used to produce steam to generate additional electricity via a steam turbine. This type of power plant is being installed in increasing numbers around the world where there is access to substantial quantities of natural gas.
